# Energy intensity and efficiency
Firstly note that within the framework of this transport energy model:
- efficiency is defined as the distance per unit of energy use (e.g. km/MJ) 
- intensity is defined as the energy use per unit of activity (e.g. MJ/passenger-km). See {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/activity:text:this}} on activity in case you are confused.

Below is a chart showing the intensity per drive/engine/powertrain type within the model for a single year in time. This is a simple way to see how the energy intensity of different drive types compare to each other. It allows you to observe not just how drive types compare but also how different vehicle types and even modes (e.g. rail, road, air) compare to each other.

And then, see below the efficiency for all those combinations of drive/vehicle type within the road sector (mode):

Note that because of the way we model non-road we dont have efficiency data for those modes. See {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/non_road:text:here}} for more information on how we model non-road transport.
