# Guide
This page will help you with using this web app. 

Fundamentally the web app is designed in the hope that it will encourage you to look deeply at the results and learn about the energy transition. To do this, the web app is also designed to explain how the model works and how to interpret the results. It allows the user to run the model so that they get the feeling that they are in control and are more motivated to look into the results. 

- Find out about {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/how_model_works:text:how the model works here.}}
- Learn about {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/reading_the_results:text:reading the results here.}}
- Read about the {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/about_the_model:text:technical details of the model here.}}

When you are ready, I suggest going back to the main page and running the model. Then as you go, read the guides to learn about the model and the results, and then run the model again with different inputs to see how the results change - or even run different economies to see how their projections differ.

Finally, remember, a projection is just one possible future in many. This model is designed to help you understand what might happen in the future, not predict it. It is at the end of the day a tool to help policy makers and researchers understand the energy transition.
