# Analytical pieces

My intention here is to give a view into some of the things I'm writing for our upcoming reports. If you actually do read it I would be interested in thoughts. But no pressure.

## The potential of BEVs in passenger transport

  - BEV's are currently one of, if not the most promising solution for reducing emissions now. Even so, they require government support to reach the level of preexisiting support that ICE's have. Proof of the benefits of this support can already be seen in China, where trillion(billions?) of dollars of early investment have led to the development of a world-leading BEV industry, as well as the infrastructure to support these cheap, efficient vehicles. This is a model that other economies should follow, as the benefits of BEVs are clear:

  - Low conventional and CO2 emissions
  - High efficiency
  - Low noise
  - Affordability 
  - Energy security

  - However, the transition to BEVs is not without its challenges. Given the clear benefits of switching to BEVs entirely, it is more important to understand the potential risks of the transition, so that they can be mitigated. 
    
    - The development of variable renewables is leading to issues around grid stability and high electricity prices. This threatens to undermine affordability and ease of use, which are fundamental benefits of BEVs, which could threaten the BEV transition itself.
    - Development of charging infrastructure will be a chicken and egg problem until enough BEVs are on the road to justify private investments. This is exaclty the same as with gas stations in the early days of ICEs. Fortunately, relative to the cost of other areas of the transition, this is a relatively cheap problem to solve - each gas station costs around $1mUSD to build, while even a fast charging station only costs around $10kUSD (although this does not include the transmission/distribution investment costs).
    - Charging availability and grid stability are related to the ease of use of BEVs. So is the range of the vehicle. Cold weather range issues are a problem that is already being seen in some economies, since in very cold temperatures, the range of BEVs can be reduced by up to 40%. Consumer's can be fickle and this issue could be enough to put the regular consumer off BEVs, even if ICE's have their own range issues.
    - BEV's are fundamentally a consumer product so the public perception of the product is crucial to its success. As such, issues like ensuring the affordability, availability of charging infrastructure and the stability of the grid are crucial to the success of this transition.
    - We are all aware of the risk that geopolitical tensions can have on the supply of batteries and even BEVs themselves. This is exemplified by recent waves of trade tariffs targeting BEVs. This will lead to slower development, but a more diverse supply chain for BEVs. Given the new state of the industry, it's become especially important that shortages in materials and battery production are addressed, as the current projected supply of both is not enough to meet the demand for BEVs amid other uses for batteries. This issue threatens to affect the energy security beenfits of BEVs, as well as the affordability and availability of the vehicles.
    - Finally, the transition to BEVs within most APEC economies is reliant on the second hand car market, which is expected to change significantly if the transition to BEVs is successful. This is because {{link:https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles:text:the current global trade in used cars}} is not set up for BEV's which contain valuable parts that can be used elsewhere in the original economy. This is similar to the issue of removing catalytic converters, which are high in precious metals, from ICE's. This is a problem that could lead to a significant slowdown in the transition to BEVs, as the second hand car market is a crucial part of the car market in most APEC economies.

## Hard to abate transport sectors

- Graph of energy use in passenger vs these sectors
  - Establish that no matter the technology, the potential we see is because of the state of technology now. As we saw with BEVs, sustained investment and research can make solutions viable, even if they aren’t now.
  - Focusing on a balance between technology neutrality and picking winners will help to encourage the best results
    - China PICKED a winner in BEVs but in most cases it’s less clear what the winners are in the other transport sectors.
    - Technology neutrality might mean we don’t achieve our climate goals, even if it means less economic risk. We should be mindful of that when considering the social and economic costs of climate change.

## The variety of transport systems within APEC

Aim to show all the most important factors which affect economies transitions so that readers can think about how they might/might-not affect their economies – show chart of regional energy use with specific sectors highlighted in each economy. – two pages?

- **SEA – 2w**
  - Explain how this allows for dense, less-public transport-oriented cities with high efficiency > but maybe lower quality of life
  - Explain difficulty of importing used EV cars

- **China – heavy freight transition**
  - Passenger transport is almost done already. Fantastic.
  - But even as they are moving to a more service-based economy, they are planning to transition their heavy trucks to boats and rail.

- **West – high vehicle ownership**
  - Strong, non-price-oriented consumer preferences (e.g. political affiliation, high driving ranges) mean that these economies might have just as difficult a time as any in encouraging the BEV transition.
  - More optimistic emissions targets means more pressure on the freight transition

- **Japan – high PT**
  - Show how this results in low vehicle ownership. How can other economies replicate this or is it a kind of natural advantage?
  - Still, the current focus on hybrids in passenger transport means that they will need to rely on low carbon fuels for decarbonisation. This further affects their own energy security as an energy importing nation.
  - Am I being too harsh on Japan? Will they allow me to say these things?
