# Analytical pieces

My intention here is to give a view into some of the things I'm writing for our upcoming reports. If you actually do read it I would be interested in thoughts. But no pressure.

## The potential of BEVs in light and medium sized vehicles

- The benefits of BEV's are clear, and in almost all cases make them the best consumer choice for a car or motorcycle. The benefits include:
    - Low conventional and CO2 emissions
    - High efficiency
    - Low noise
    - Affordability
    - Energy security
    - Ease of use

- However, they require government support to reach the level of preexisting support that ICEs have. Benefits of this support can already be seen in China, where early investment has led to the development of a world-leading BEV industry, and the charging infrastructure to support their high BEV stock share (~20% of all cars).

- For those economies who are already automobile manufacturers, they have a tough decision ahead of them; risk trying to compete with China in the BEV market, or continue building ICEs and slowly lose market share. We have seen some manufacturers try to focus on hybrids and FCEV's, and now some economies are supporting their manufacturers BEV transition by placing tariffs on Chinese EV's.

- However, the transition to BEVs is not without its challenges. It is crucial to understand the potential risks of the transition to mitigate them effectively.
    - The development of variable renewables is leading to issues around grid stability and high electricity prices. This threatens to undermine the affordability and ease of use, which are fundamental benefits of BEVs.
    - Developing charging infrastructure will be a chicken-and-egg problem until enough BEVs are on the road to justify private investments. This is similar to the early days of gas stations for ICEs. Investment costs still vary, however a set of fast chargers is expected to be around the same price as a gas station (up to $1million USD), and much cheaper for slow chargers. Consideration must be given to the cost of building transmission and distribution infrastructure to support them, as this can vary depending on the location of the charger.
    - Charging availability and grid stability are related to the ease of use of BEVs, as is the vehicle range. Cold weather range issues occur in some economies, with BEV range reduced by up to 40% in very cold temperatures. This is because of the need for heating as well as cold temperatures decreasing the capacity of the battery. This could deter consumers, despite ICEs having their own cold weather issues.
    - BEVs are fundamentally a consumer product, so public perception is crucial to their success. Ensuring affordability, availability of charging infrastructure, and grid stability are essential to the success of this transition.
    - Geopolitical tensions can impact the supply of batteries and BEVs. Recent trade tariffs targeting BEVs exemplify this, leading to slower development but a more diverse supply chain. Addressing shortages in materials and battery production is crucial as current projected supply is insufficient to meet BEV demand.
    - Most likely, the transition to BEVs within most APEC economies will rely on the second-hand car market, which will need to change significantly. The {{link:https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles:text:the current global trade in used cars}} is not set up for BEVs, which contain valuable parts that can be reused. This issue could slow down the transition, as the second-hand car market is how most APEC economies import their cars.

## Hard to abate transport sectors

- Compared to the use of BEVs in light and medium-sized vehicles, heavy vehicles do not have a clear transition pathway. Big trucks, boats, planes, and even trains are harder to power with batteries due to the need for higher power and longer distances. Alternative solutions include hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), biofuels, and low-carbon fuel alternatives, but each has its own development and cost challenges. Overall, the situation is much less certain, and it warrants a more technology-neutral approach to decarbonization.
    - FCEVs: As explained in the hydrogen section, the expected cost of producing hydrogen raises concerns. It may never be cost-competitive with its alternatives, making development risky. However, some switching to FCEVs is included in our projections due to their potential.
    - Biofuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel for planes may be the best solution, even though it may never be cost-competitive. For biodiesel, biogasoline, and bioethanol, cost-competitiveness potential is relatively high but they are being overtaken by BEVs. Biofuel development also poses negative externalities, such as deforestation and land use that could impact food production. This makes biofuels a risky proposition for decarbonizing transport.
        - Some economies, like Indonesia, are well-suited for biofuel production due to their fertile land. This helps in decarbonizing hard-to-abate transport types, but it's not a scalable solution for the rest of APEC.

    - Low carbon fuels:
        - Ammonia: Primarily considered for shipping and possibly co-firing in the power sector, ammonia is energy-dense but toxic and difficult to handle, making it a risky decarbonization option.
        - Efuels: These can match existing fuel formulations and serve as complete drop-in replacements, making them a promising decarbonization solution. However, they are expensive to produce, relying on the cost of hydrogen production and carbon capture, both of which are uncertain.

    - High energy density BEV's:
        - High energy density BEVs hold the most promise for decarbonizing heavy trucks and trains. If successful, they would be the best solution due to their ability to complement existing charging infrastructure, reducing transition costs. While they place additional pressure on the grid, the overall effect is lower compared to the electricity required for hydrogen and efuels or the land-use cost of biofuels. Thus, our projections prioritize BEVs for heavy trucks and trains and they even feature in planes and boats, however due to the uncertainty they are still supplemented by FCEVs, biofuels, and low-carbon fuels.-There is a good argument for economies to commit to BEV trucks and trains now, to encourage rapid technology development and ensure that the infrastructure is in place when the technology is ready. 

    - No matter the technology, the potential we see is based on current technological advancements. Sustained investment and research can make solutions viable. Governments should strike a balance between a technology-neutral approach and picking winners, as the potential of these technologies is uncertain and constantly evolving.

## The variety of transport systems within APEC

{{graph:energy_use_by_region.html}}

- **High density developing – Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillipines, Thailand, Viet Nam**
    - Generally able to be categorised as south-east asian economies. These economies have a high population density, increasing vehicle ownership and high reliance on motorcycles.
    - The high population density means that these economies are well-suited for public transport, if the right policies are put in place.
    - Motorcycles use about half as much energy per km than cars, and they are expected to be easier to transition to BEVs. This makes it so the transition can be done more quickly and with less investment.
    - Most of these economies are working on their own BEV industries, which could be a good thing as it means they can develop their own technology and not be reliant on imports.

- **China**
    - China is currently the factory of the world. This means they have a large amount of heavy freight activity which is difficult to decarbonise. China is actively promoting the development of rail and ship networks to take freight off the roads. This is a good strategy as rail and ships are inherently much more efficient. China is also transitioning to a service-based economy, which decreases the expected activity in freight transport.
    - The BEV transition started early on and with the strong cultural pride around BEV's, it is likely they will achieve a 100% stock share well before most other economies.
    - A rapidly aging population means China will eventually see a decrease in passenger activity, resulting in pressures from maintenance of the less used railways and roads, especailly after such rapid growth. This is a good thing for the environment, but it will put pressure on the economy in other ways.

- **City states: Singapore, Hong Kong, Brunei**
    - High population density and easier administration make these economies well-suited for a quick BEV transition.
    - Singapore's Early Turnover Scheme helps to speed up the turnover of ICE vehicles, which plays a large part in achieving a projected 100% BEV stock share for light vehicles and buses by 2040.
    - High public transport shares mean that these economies have a relatively low vehicle ownership rate, improving efficiency and making the transition easier -  it is easier to replace a few public buses than many private cars.
    - Low driving ranges make BEV vehicles even more attractive. This is especailly important for freight trucks, which are normally held back by their needs for high power over long distances.
    
- **Low density rich – Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States**
    - Strong, non-price-oriented consumer preferences (e.g. political affiliation, high driving ranges, heavy cars) mean that these economies might have just as difficult a time as any in encouraging the BEV transition.
    - More optimistic emissions targets means more pressure on the freight transition, which in turn puts more pressure on charging/hydrogen-refilling infrastructure and grid stability.
    - Low passenger transport shares provide an avenue for improvement, if the right policies are put in place.

- **High density rich - Japan, Korea, Chinese Taipei**
{{graph:lmdi_passenger_road_Target_09_ROK.html}}
    - The graph shows the drivers of changes in energy use in passenger transport. Korea and Japan are the only economies where passenger km is causing a decrease in energy use. This comes as a result of a mix of high preexising transport use and a decreasing population. Like with China, this will reduce emissions, but also make it harder to maintain the transport infrastructure.
    - By comparing to other economies we can see the effect of public transport on the amount of cars on the road. Japan has one of the lowest vehicle ownership rates in the world, yet their people still enjoy the ability to travel cheaply and efficiently due to their well developed public transport system. 
    - Other economies could replicate this by investing in public transport, but it is not an easy solution - public transport requires government investment and organisation, while cars are a private good (even if they still need roads). Although, a slight increase in public transport in all economies could have large benefits on social welfare, emissions, and energy use for low marginal costs.
    - Japan and korea maintain a strong sense of technology neutrality within the current energy transition. This is for many reasons, ranging from culture, energy security, and the fact that they are net importers of energy making them more vulnerable to negative effects of committing to the wrong technology. Japan and Korea have strong focuses on hydrogen and low carbon fuels, which they ?might be able to process in their domestical chemical industries? as well as develop energy security through strong trade partnerships?. Japan also has a strong focus on hybrids, yet it remains to be seen if this market will fail to take off due to the rise of BEVs.

- **Low density developing and middle income -  Chile, Peru, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Russia**
    - These might be the economies with the slowest expected transport transition as the mix of lower incomes and higher driving ranges makes the transition to BEVs more difficult. These economies also have quite unique Targets, such as a high reliance on gas vehicles in Peru and Russia, a very optimistic target in Chile, and a pessimistic targets in Papua New Guinea and Mexico.

Some notes: lower incomes doesnt necessarily mean evs are less suited if they become cheap, however because of issues with used car imports and the correlation between income levels and used car imports, these lower income economies might be disadvantaged in the transition.
