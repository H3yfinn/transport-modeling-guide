# Mileage

Mileage is the distance a vehicle will travel in a year. It is multiplied by the efficiency of the vehicle to determine the amount of fuel used by that kind of vehicle in a year. Below you can see an example of our current figures for mielage in the model:

It is relatively difficult to find data on mileage for vehicles. In a lot of cases we use data from certain economies with better data collection, and base mileage in other economies off that. For example, New Zealand has great mileage data from their Ministry of Transport.

It should also be noted that due to the problem of matching our input data up with the energy data we must use in the base year, our optimisation process will often change the mileage data to better match the energy data.
