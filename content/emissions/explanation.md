# Emissions
Emissions are pretty easy to calculate, you just need to make some mappings between emissions factors (you can find them on the UFCCC website) and you fuel types, and then times the factors by your energy use by fuel. This gives you the chart below:

Then if you want to calculate the theoretical emissions from generating the electricity used in BEV's, youc an do that if you have the energy use from your power sector. The result is the chart below:

You can then start to analyse how different vehicle types affect emission, such as in the chart below:

{{graph:share_of_emissions_by_vehicle_type_Target_01_AUS.html}}

And finally, if you have lifecycle emissions data, you can calculate the lifecycle emissions of your vehicles, as in the chart below:

You can also great emissions versions of the LMDI charts you will find {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/lmdi:text:here}}, which will break down the drivers of changes in emissions.
