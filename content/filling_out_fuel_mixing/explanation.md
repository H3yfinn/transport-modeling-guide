# Guide to filling out the fuel mixing assumptions

{{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/fuel_mixing:text:Fuel mixing}} is a way to reduce the emissions intensity of a fuel by mixing it with another fuel. For example, biodiesel can be mixed with diesel to reduce the emissions of the diesel-fueled vehicle using that diesel.

After downloading this workbook in the staging page, to fill in the fuel mixing form, you need to keep in mind the following:
- the sum of fuel mix shares should be 1 or less for each year and Fuel in the table above
- the fuel mix shares should be positive
- the economy, fuel, new_fuel and year columns are mandatory plus they must match the categories already in the sheet if you download it. See the page on {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/concordances:text:concordances}} to see what is currently used in the model.

This workbook has many other pages but except for the simple to use regions, international_supply_side and demand_side pages, the others are really just mess that i dont want to clean up for fear of losing some notes.
