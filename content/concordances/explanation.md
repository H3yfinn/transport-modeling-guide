# Concordances

Perhaps its a word that i've bastardized but i use it to refer to the mapping of all the permutations of different categories in the model, to help with mapping and checking that no categories have been missed out. For example, it can be used to check that all the different types of fuels that are used in the model are accounted for in the {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/fuel_mixing:text:fuel mixing assumptions}}.

You can use the concordances to understand all the different categories that are used in the model. If you want to see more specific ones you can go to the {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/concordances_measures:text:measures}} or {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/concordances_fuels:text:fuels}} concordances.

Also, if you're confused you can refer to the glossary {{link:https://transport-energy-modelling.com/content/glossary:text:here}}.
