# Charging
In our modelling we have built a method to estimate the number of publicly funded chargers that are required based on the stocks of vehicles. We have the following parameters:

Generally a good rule of thumb is 1 publicly available slow charger per 10 BEV's. However as you can see there are many factors. It is actually normally better to consider the kwh of the battery and count out the kw of chargers (fast/slow) per kwh of battery. This is because the battery size is a good proxy for the amount of energy that needs to be put into the vehicle. Then there are also the charging patterns of different vehicles, which could be quite different, although as of 2024, its still early days for EV's so we dont have a lot of data on this.

See a projection of chargers below:

Some other factors affecting the number of chargers required in an economy are:
 - The amount of private chargers that are available.
 - Urban density and population density.
 - The size of vehicles and the size of the batteries.
 - The amount of time that vehicles are parked.
 - The amount of time that vehicles are parked in public spaces.
 - The amount of driving people do.
