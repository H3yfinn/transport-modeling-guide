# Activity
Activity can be split into two units, passenger-km and freight-tonne-km. See the equations below (where occupancy is the amount of passengers in a vehicle and load is the weight of the freight in a vehicle):

- Passenger-km = Occupancy * Distance travelled
- Freight-tonne-km = Load * Distance travelled

These are key indicators for the transport sector, given that the 2 major factors in determining any economic sector's energy use is the activity, and the energy intensity of that activity. 
- Changing the activity can be done by changing the distance travelled, the occupancy or the load.
- Changing the energy intensity can be done by changing the efficiency of the vehicle.

The main factors that affect activity within the transport model are:
- Stocks: the number of vehicles in the fleet
- Mileage: the distance travelled by each vehicle
- Occupancy: the number of passengers in each vehicle
- Load: the weight of the freight in each vehicle

And for passenger transport we also have:
- Vehicle ownership: otherwise called stocks per capita and essentially is a measure for passenger vehicles which heavily affected by the amount of road travel that each member of the population does. If this is low (for example in japan where trains are more popular) then the vehicle ownership (number of vehicles needed) is lower. In the USA this is high.
