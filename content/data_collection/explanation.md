# Data collection
If you look at the concordances you will realise that there is a LOT of input data. This is probably what i've spent the most time on, yet I feel like I could spend a lot more time on it.

The way I manage the input data is by using a separate system called the Transport Data System. The TDS has a few major tasks:

- cleaning and categorising data that is gathered from various sources. These all need to be categorised in a way that is consistent with the model.
- concatenating all the data and making sure that it is all in the same format.
- identifying what data we have multiple sources for and then deciding which source to use.
- identifying what data we don't have and then deciding how to fill in the gaps.

You can find the code {{link:https://github.com/H3yfinn/transport_data_system:text:here}}, although I wouldn't recommend seriously looking at using it, maybe just extracting the bits that you need.

You can also access the input data that is used in the model {{link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXp2zI13YzQsmzNwGwsOPQW3eEB53NKi/view?usp=drive_link:text:here}}
